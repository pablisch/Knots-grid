       <p>Some letters with diacritical marks: a&#768;	a&#769;	a&#770;	a&#771;	o&#768;	o&#769;	o&#770;	o&#771;	</p>
       <p>They are displayed by writing constructs such as <b>a&#38#768;</b> to dsiplay <b>a&#768;</b>.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Reserved entities are also written using enitity names or enitity numbers, e.g. <b>&#38</b> is coded in HTML as <b>&#38#38</b>, while <b>&#60</b> is coded as <b>&#38#60</b>. </p>
       <br>
       <p>The <b>&#8364;</b> symbol can be coded using an entity name, <b>&#38euro;</b>, an entity number, <b>&#38#8364;</b> or as an entity hexadecimal, <b>&#38#x20AC;</b>.</p>
       <br>
       <p>You can find many of the symbol codes <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_symbols.asp" target="_blank">here</a>, such as &#9760 and &#9763.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Emojis are simply characters that cannot be typed on a normal keyboard and so they each have an entity number just like any other character.</p>     <p>Any letter, symbol or emoji coded with an entity <b>number</b> should start with <b>&#38#</b> followed by the number and end with <b>;</b> so that the browser understands that it should display the designated character, symbol, emoji, etc.</p>
       <p>Here are some favourites: <b>&#38#128516;</b> will give you &#128516;, <b>&#38#128525;</b> will give you &#128525; and <b>&#38#128151;</b> will give you &#128151;.</p>
       <p>You can find many emoji codes <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
